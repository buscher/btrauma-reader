In ~2013 I tried to rebuild the game [trauma](http://www.traumagame.com/) with Qt5 and QML.
You can play it online for free [here](http://www.traumagame.com/). But it is a great game, please support it.
It requires the full game data placed under ~/.config/btrauma/data.

I only managed to recreate the menu, it was a good QML learning experience. never could really figure out the level structure..
